    The <i>WASABI</i> ANR project, started in January 2017, aims at the construction of a 2 million song knowledge
    base that combines metadata collected from music databases on the Web, metadata resulting from the analysis of

    The built database will then be used for the development of semantic applications with high added value and
    an interactive WebAudio application<sup>1</sup>. It is a 42-month project founded by the French National Agency
    for Research (ANR contract ANR-16-CE23-0017-01).
