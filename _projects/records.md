    This interdisciplinary research articulates quantitative and qualitative methods. It relies on an original data col-
    lection protocol that combines anonymized individual listening history data on the platform; detailed self-declared
    information collected through a large-scale web survey; in-depth interviews with volunteer participants.
    Project members come from different academic backgrounds, some from the social sciences (mainly sociology
    and geography), some from computer science and signal processing. The project is led by Thomas Louail (CNRS,
    Géographie Cités), Philippe Coulangeon (CNRS, Observatoire Sociologique du Changement), Camille Roth (CNRS,
    Centre Marc Bloch), Jean-Samuel Beuscart (Orange Labs SENSE) and Manuel Moussallam (Deezer R&D). More
    information (in french) is available on the project website, records.huma-num.fr
