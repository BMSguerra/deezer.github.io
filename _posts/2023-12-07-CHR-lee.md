The paper explore the relationship between population size and diversity in music preferences. It analyzes 69 million music streaming events from France, covering over 408,000 users across 96 regions. The study reveals that both individual and collective musical tastes diversify as population size increases. This trend holds true across different age and gender groups, with notable gender-based differences in music choices appearing after a certain age.

Additionally, the research delves into the shared musical repertoire among listeners and examines potential confounding factors. It introduces a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) model for future studies, aimed at uncovering the causal pathways influencing cultural diversity in music consumption. The findings contribute to a broader understanding of cultural consumption patterns and the factors that shape them.
