Since 2017, the goal of the two-million song WASABI database has been to build a knowledge graph linking collected metadata (artists,discography, producers, dates, etc.) with metadata generated by the analysis of both the songsâ€™ lyrics (topics, places, emotions, structure, etc.) and audio signal (chords, sound, etc.). It relies on natural language processing and machine learning methods for extraction, and semantic Web frameworks  for  representation  and  integration.  It  describes  more  than 2  millions  commercial  songs,  200K  albums  and  77K  artists.  It  can  be exploited by music search engines, music professionals (e.g. journalists,radio presenters, music teachers) or scientists willing to analyze popular music published since 1950. It is available under an open license, in multiple formats and with online and open source services including an interactive navigator, a REST API and a SPARQL endpoint.
