In the recent years, singing voice separation systems
showed increased performance due to the use of supervised training.
The design of training datasets is known as a crucial factor in the
performance of such systems.

We investigate on how the characteristics of the training dataset impacts the separation performances of state-of-the-art singing voice separation algorithms. We show that the separation quality and diversity are two important and complementary assets of a
good training dataset. We also provide insights on possible transforms to perform data augmentation for this task.
