In this paper, we present a novel cover detection approach leveraging lyrics information extracted from audio. We use as Singing Voice Recognition system to extract automatically a lyrics transcripts from the audio and Cover detection is then framed as a noisy text-matching task between obtained transcripts.

As songs may not contain lyrics we complement this lyrics-based cover detection system with a more classic tonal-based method.

We show extensive empirical evidence that lyrics information can significantly help cover detection and that both lyrics and tonal information are complementary for this task.
