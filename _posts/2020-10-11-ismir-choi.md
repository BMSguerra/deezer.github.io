In this work, we set up a novel task of <i>playlist context prediction</i>. From a large playlist title corpus, we manually curate a subset of multilingual labels referring to user activities (e.g. <i>"jogging"</i>, <i>"meditation"</i>, <i>"au calme"</i>), which we further consider in the prediction task. 

We explore different approaches to calculate and aggregate track-level contextual semantic embeddings in order to represent a playlist and
predict the playlist context from this representation. Our baseline results show that the task can be addressed with a simple framework using 
information from either audio or distributional similarity of tracks in terms of track-context co-occurrences.

This work has been presented at the <i>First Workshop on NLP for Music and Audio</i> (<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/nlp4musa/schedule?authuser=0">NLP4MusA</a>), co-located with <a href="https://www.ismir2020.net/">ISMIR 2020</a>.
It is an extended version of Jeong Choiâ€™s research internship at Deezer in 2019.
